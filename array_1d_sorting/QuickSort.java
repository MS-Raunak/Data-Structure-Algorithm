/**
 * Quick Sort:
 * It is a divide and conquered problem.
 * Technique:
 * 1- suppose arr = [20, 22, 13, 5, 97]
 * 2- where Pivot element is the last element of the given arr which is 97
 * 3- Now placed all smallest element on the left side of pivot element
     and all largest element on the right side of pivot element
 * 4- Above 3rd step we are achieving in below code using partition method
 * 5- After that 1 element(pivot) got their actual index
 * 6 - Now two partitioned array beside pivot have to sort
 * 7- Now call the quickSort method recursively to sort the array
 *
 * Time Complexity Of QuickSort
 * In Worst Case
     O(n^2), because of
     worst case occurs when pivot ele always either be smallest or largest.
     The reason of worst case is Array is already sorted
 * In Average Case:
 * Average : O(nlogn)

/**
 * The functionality of above code
 * The swap method swaps two elements in the array.
 * The partition method partitions the array around a pivot element (here, the last element), placing smaller elements to the left and larger elements to the right.
 * The quickSort method is the main sorting function, which recursively sorts the array by partitioning it and sorting the subarrays.
 * In the main method, an array is initialized, and then the quickSort method is called to sort the array.
